			<strong> Signing in and out of the System</strong>
		
		
		<p>Access to Homebase requires a Username and a Password. The form
			looks like this:
		
		
		<p>
		
		
		<table align="center">
			<tr>
				<td>Username:</td>
				<td><input type="text" name="user" tabindex="1"></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Password:</td>
				<td><input type="password" name="pass" tabindex="2"></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td colspan="2" align="center"><input type="submit" name="Login"
					value="Login"></td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>
			If you are a <i>new applicant</i>, you can sign in with the Username
			<strong>guest</strong> and no Password. Once you sign in you will be
			able to fill out and submit an application form on-line.
		
		<p>
			If you are a <i>volunteer or staff member</i>, your Username is your
			first name followed by your phone number with no spaces.
		
		<ul>
			<li>For example, if your first name is John and your phone number is
				(401)-123-4567, your Username would be <strong>John4011234567</strong>.
			
			<li>Remember that your Username and Password are <em>case-sensitive</em>.
			
			<li>If you mistype your Username or Password, the following error
				message will appear:
				<p class="error">
					Error: invalid username/password<br />if you cannot remember your
					password, ask the Volunteer Coordinator to reset it for you.
				</p>
				<p>At this point, you can retry entering your Username and Password
					(if you think you may have mistyped them).
			
			<li>If all else fails, or if you do not remember your password,
				please contact the <a href="mailto:jpowers@rmhprovidence.org">Volunteer Coordinator</a>.
		
		</ul>
		<p>
			Remember to <strong>logout</strong> when you are finished using
			Homebase.
